The docx file shows some point and click and syntax and screenshot to do repeated measures analyses in SPSS   

The file example_analysis.sps shows how analyses are done.   
In particular it is assumed that visits are not for each subject at uniform times, so there are macros that  
for a given outcome measure  
- describe when the non-missing repeated measurements are done   
- what the distribution is of the outcome is   
- spaghetti plots and panel plots of the profiles  
- to perform the several analyses to see which fits best (so including residual plots and observed vs predicted plots)   

Note that the macros and gpl files are in a separate folder which has to be specified in the example.sps  
file using a FILE HANDLE statement.  

** the example_create_db for replicates.sas ***.
This is a SAS file to run on the original dataset to make another dataset   
This other dataset contains  
- the original measurements/record (replicate=0), e.g. time=1, 2, 3, ..  
- for each subject extra repeated measurements (replicate=1) with extra intermediate time points, e.g.  
   1,1.1,1.2, ...1.9, 2, 2.1,2.2., ..., 2.9, 3, 3.1,3.2, ....
   but with outcome measurement data made missing. This way the predicted profile can be output   
  with much more resolution.   

** example_duration_auc.sps  
This file contains examples how to calculate on the 'high resolution' dataset made above   
summary measures like the duration above a threshold or the AUC and then do analyses on them (compare between groups)
