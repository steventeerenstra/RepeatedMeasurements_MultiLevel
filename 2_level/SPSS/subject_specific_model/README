The docx file shows some point and click and syntax and screenshot to do repeated measures analyses in SPSS   

The file example.sps shows how analyses are done.   
In particular it is assumed that visits are not for each subject at uniform times, so there are macros that  
for a given outcome measure  
- describe when the non-missing repeated measurements are done   
- what the distribution is of the outcome is   
- spaghetti plots and panel plots of the profiles  
- to perform the several analyses to see which fits best (so including residual plots and observed vs predicted plots)   

Note that the macros and gpl files are in a separate folder which has to be specified in the example.sps file.
