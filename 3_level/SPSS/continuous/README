SPSS syntaxes for 3 levels: measurements within subjects within clusters     
modelled by random effects, but this can be changed in one of the macro arguments    
Data have to be in long data format    
macro to estimate random and fixed effects and assess the fit (residual plots, observed vs predicted plots)    

adapt the file handle 'gpl' to the directory path where the folder "gpl" is. this contains the graphics generating files and the macros for analyses  

adapt the file handle 'data' to the directory path where the dataset .sav is.  
  

First open the syntax file(not the data file). This is because multiple datasets are used and they need to have names as defined in the syntax file.   

  
When something gets stuck, close the datasets without saving them. This is because auxiliary variables and datasets are made and you must not save those otherwise a fresh start is not possible.
